The repo contains code to build the propagator of a pulse sequence for a 6-level transmon

The current implementation computes the propagator for a single period of the drive field.
The propagator for a sequence of pulses is to be implemented. It would be inder the restriction that a single pulse has a duration which is an integer number of the drive field period.
