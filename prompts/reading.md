## Folding the Floquet propagator

Equation (12) in Ref. \[Phys. Rev. B 99, 094303 (2019)] shows exactly how the “fold-back’’ from Sambe to physical space is carried out by **summing the extended-space blocks**, i.e. the prescription above.&#x20;

For a comprehensive pedagogical treatment see the review by P. Hänggi *et al.*, Chap. 5 “Driven Quantum Systems’’ (in particular the discussion around Eqs. 5.116–5.118 on reconstructing physical states from Sambe space). ([physik.uni-augsburg.de][1])
