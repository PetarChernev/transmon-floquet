This is a clever idea! Yes, it's valid and could be more efficient in certain regimes. Let me work through the theory.

## Floquet Theory with Extended Period

### Validity
If $H(t)$ has period $T$, then it also has period $kT$ for any integer $k$. So we can apply Floquet theory with either period.

### Fourier Coefficient Transformation
Original decomposition with period $T$:
$$H(t) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} C^{(n)} e^{in\omega t}, \quad \omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$

New decomposition with period $T' = kT$:
$$H(t) = \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} C'^{(m)} e^{im\omega' t}, \quad \omega' = \frac{2\pi}{kT} = \frac{\omega}{k}$$

### Relationship Between Coefficients
Since both represent the same function:
$$\sum_n C^{(n)} e^{in\omega t} = \sum_m C'^{(m)} e^{im\omega t/k}$$

Matching terms: $n\omega = m\omega/k$ implies $n = m/k$

Therefore:
$$C'^{(m)} = \begin{cases}
C^{(m/k)} & \text{if } m \equiv 0 \pmod{k} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

### Explicit Form for Our Hamiltonian
For $H_0$ (time-independent):
- $C_0'^{(m)} = H_0$ if $m = 0$, zero otherwise

For $H_1$ (time-dependent):
- $C_1'^{(m)} = C_1^{(m/k)}$ when $m$ is divisible by $k$, zero otherwise

### Efficiency Comparison

**Method 1**: Compute $U(T,0)$ then $[U(T,0)]^k$
- Floquet matrix size: $(2M+1)d \times (2M+1)d$
- One matrix exponentiation + $k-1$ matrix multiplications

**Method 2**: Compute $U(kT,0)$ directly
- Floquet matrix size: $(2M'+1)d \times (2M'+1)d$ where $M' \approx kM$ (to capture same physics)
- One matrix exponentiation (of larger matrix)

### Trade-offs
- Method 2 has sparser Fourier coefficients (only every $k$-th is non-zero)
- But needs larger truncation $M' \approx kM$ to capture the same high-frequency effects
- The larger matrix exponentiation could be more expensive than $k$ smaller matrix multiplications

**Recommendation**: For small $k$ (say $k < 10$), Method 1 is likely more efficient. For large $k$, the sparsity in Method 2 might make it competitive, especially if using sparse matrix techniques.
